# Mines Game
## Introduction
This is Minesweeper clone I made with [React](http://www.reactjs.org). I created it mainly as a learning exercise and a demonstration of React's capabilities, but of course you can also play it.

Since this project is just a front-end web application, once built it can be hosted on any server as static HTML/JavaScript/CSS content. A working version can be found on [my web site](http://www.seanrobinette.com/mines/index.html).

## Build Instructions
To build the project:
- Make sure [Node is installed](https://nodejs.org/)
- Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/SeanRobinette/mines-game.git`
- Make sure you're in the right directory `cd mines-game`
- Run the build script `npm run build`
- Output will be in the `/build` directory

To run the live development server instead:
- Run `npm start`
